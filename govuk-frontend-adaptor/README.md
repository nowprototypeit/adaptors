What is this project?
===

Now Prototype It is a fully configurable, high fidelity prototype kit for in-browser prototyping.  It has a plugin system and a variant system which together allow anyone to take a design system and create a prototype kit from it.

This project is the GOV.UK Frontend Adaptor for Now Prototype It.  It allows you to use the GOV.UK Frontend library in your prototype kit.

How do I use it?
===

You can create a new kit by creating an empty directory and running the following command in it:

```bash
npx nowprototypeit --variant=@nowprototypeit/govuk-frontend-adaptor create
```

This will create a new kit using the GOV.UK Frontend Adaptor to give you a GOV.UK Frontend based prototype kit.
